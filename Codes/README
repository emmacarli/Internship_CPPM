To be run in order:
- bracketing_IRFs_AEff.py : bracket the IRFs AEff component
- simulation.py : simulate events
- simulations_energy_modifications.py : modify the energies of simulations. as close as we could get to EDisp bracketing
- modified_energy_histograms_comparison.py : create histograms of counts to check energy modifications made on simulations
- data_analysis_binned.py : generate a fit and plots for each bracketing
- spectrum_fitting.py : fit spectral points and compare them to model
- pvalue_calculator.py : calculate p value for each fit
- parameter_fix.py : fix all parameters of the model for asymmetrical error calculation
- asymmetrical_errors.py



There are many occurrences of paths to my folders -- you will have to change that when running these codes as my folders won't exist anymore!
