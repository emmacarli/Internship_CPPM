These plotting scripts have been adapted from ctools'. 
Main changes :
- being able to plot at a fixed offset, for multiple IRFs
- always testing for the ENERG/ETRUE axis name since it is named differently in prod2 and prod3b
- plot a scalemap of a bracketed EDisp component in an IRF 

Then some details like...
- more space on the graphs
- titles
- grids
- save the plot rather than show
- IRFs width in deg rather than arcmin
- etc ...

Comments have been left as such.

I'd be happy to answer any questions: emma.carli@outlook.com
